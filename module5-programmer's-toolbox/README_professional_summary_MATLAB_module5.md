# 🧰 Module 5: Programmer’s Toolbox  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module5-programmer's-toolbox`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module explored MATLAB’s vast ecosystem of built-in functions and how to effectively locate, use, and evaluate them. The emphasis was on becoming self-sufficient through function discovery, proper syntax use, and testing program behavior across multiple inputs.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Using built-in MATLAB functions like `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `sort()`, `size()`, etc.
- Matrix construction and manipulation with higher control
- Documentation lookup via `help`, `doc`, and example pages
- Reading function signatures and syntax patterns
- Validating output correctness using edge and corner cases

## 🪞 Reflection

This module shifted the mindset from writing code to *leveraging code*. The real power of MATLAB lies in how many operations are already built in — and learning to find and apply the right function is just as valuable as writing it from scratch.

Function discovery became second nature after repeated use of the Help Browser and command line introspection. This toolbox will be essential for the remaining modules and any simulation workflows in real-world settings.

🔍 *MATLAB is a toolbox. And now I know where the tools are.*
