# 📊 MATLAB Signal & Data Tools – Visualization & Scripting Practice

This repository showcases my hands-on use of MATLAB for visualizing, processing, and scripting time-based and signal-driven data. Built as part of my developer transition into simulation and data tools, this project applies computational thinking, functional scripting, and visualization workflows across a modular structure.

Each module builds on the last, focusing on specific MATLAB capabilities — from workspace management to function creation and time-series plotting.
