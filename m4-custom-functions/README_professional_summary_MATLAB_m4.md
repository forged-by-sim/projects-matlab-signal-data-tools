# 🔧 M4 – Custom Functions in MATLAB  
**Folder**: `m4-custom-functions`  
**Focus**: Defining, calling, and testing reusable logic through user-defined functions

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module marked a major shift from procedural scripts to modular, reusable logic. I practiced defining custom functions, handling multiple outputs, and structuring internal logic to simulate real-world behaviors. This set the stage for scalable project architecture and simulation-style workflows.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Writing custom functions using the `function` keyword  
- Passing inputs and returning outputs  
- Structuring function files (`function_name.m`)  
- Handling multiple output arguments: `[out1, out2] = myFunction(...)`  
- Managing local variable scope  
- Designing test cases and validating outputs

### ▶️ Corners Function  
Defined a function to return the four corner values of a matrix (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Used subscript indexing and validated test cases.

## 🧠 Developer Reflection  
This was the upgrade moment. Writing reusable functions introduced abstraction, structure, and real-world simulation logic. I moved beyond repeated command-line steps and into modular, testable code design.

Being able to test logic through well-formed inputs and outputs also solidified clean design habits — essential for future modules involving branching, conditionals, and larger simulation flows.
