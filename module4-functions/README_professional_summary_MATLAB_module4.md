# 🧩 Module 4: Functions  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module4-functions`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module focused on defining, calling, and organizing reusable code blocks using MATLAB functions. Key learning goals included creating basic and multi-output functions, structuring parameter inputs/outputs, and applying real-world logic to test functions.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Writing custom functions using the `function` keyword
- Passing inputs and returning outputs
- Syntax rules for function files (`function_name.m`)
- Multiple output arguments (`[out1, out2] = myFunction(...)`)
- Local variables and workspace scope
- Function testing and edge case design

## 🪞 Reflection

This module marked a turning point in MATLAB learning — transitioning from procedural command-line tasks to true abstraction and modular programming. Writing reusable functions introduced a sense of structure and professionalism to the code.

The ability to test logic independently through well-formed input/output arguments helped reinforce clean design habits — which will be critical in more advanced topics like loops, conditional branches, and simulations.
