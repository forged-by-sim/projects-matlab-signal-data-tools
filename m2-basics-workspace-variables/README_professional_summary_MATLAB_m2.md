# 🧪 M2 – Basics: Workspace & Variables  
**Folder**: `m2-basics-workspace-variables`  
**Focus**: Command-line interaction, variable assignment, and workspace familiarity in MATLAB

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module marked the true beginning of hands-on practice in MATLAB. I explored how to work within the environment (Command Window, Editor, Workspace) and practiced foundational logic: variable creation, simple arithmetic, and output formatting.

The exercises also introduced help utilities like `help`, `doc`, and `disp()` — essential tools for self-guided learning and debugging.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Navigating MATLAB's interface: Command Window, Editor, Workspace, History  
- Executing system commands: `clc`, `clear`, `format short/long`  
- Understanding operator precedence in arithmetic expressions  
- Using documentation tools: `help`, `doc`  
- Assigning, modifying, and evaluating variables  
- Displaying results using `disp()`

## 📂 Exercises

### ▶️ CLI Variable Practice  
A short command-line exercise reinforcing variable assignment and immediate evaluation.

- Executed arithmetic expressions in the Command Window  
- Assigned values and confirmed outputs  
- Documented CLI interaction through screenshots and notes

### ▶️ Basic Math Calculator  
A simple calculator script using arithmetic logic and variable assignment.

- Simulated a basic debt calculation  
- Used compound expressions to mimic real-world financial logic  
- Printed results clearly using `disp()` formatting

## 🧠 Developer Reflection  
This was the **true starting point** of MATLAB fluency — when scripting finally moved from theory to execution. While simple on the surface, these exercises built my confidence in debugging syntax errors, understanding calculation flows, and structuring outputs for clarity.
