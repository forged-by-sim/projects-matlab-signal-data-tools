# 🧿 Module 6: Selection & Conditional Logic  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module6-selection`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module introduced MATLAB’s conditional logic syntax, allowing programs to make decisions based on inputs and state. Topics included `if`, `else`, `elseif`, logical comparisons, and input argument handling.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Writing and nesting `if`, `else`, and `elseif` statements
- Logical expressions (`==`, `<`, `>`, `&&`, `||`, `~`)
- Input validation using conditionals
- `nargin` and `nargout` to handle variable number of function arguments
- Creating test scripts and using edge/corner-case design
- Structuring reusable decision-making logic into functions

### 📁 Supplemental `.m` Files – Lesson 5 Examples (Conditional Logic)

These files demonstrate if/else branching, version control through iteration, and conditionally driven behavior. Included in `Lesson 5 Examples zip/`:

- `accumulate.m` – Demonstrates value accumulation using conditionals
- `day_of_week.m` – Returns day strings based on numeric input
- `guess_my_number_version_1.m` – Base version of a number-guessing game
- `guess_my_number_version_2.m` – Adds branching logic for feedback
- `guess_my_number_version_3.m` – Full multi-turn implementation
- `if_test.m` – Tests basic `if`/`else` conditions
- `multable.m` – Multiplication table generator
- `multable_version_1.m` – Enhanced layout or variable naming
- `multable_version_2.m` – Finalized version with refinements
- `not_smallest.m` – Compares elements to exclude minimum
- `order3.m` – Sorts three numbers using conditional chains
- `snarky_multable.m` – A humorous or customized multiplication table variant

## 🪞 Reflection

This was one of the most valuable modules so far — MATLAB transitioned from a calculator into a decision-making machine. Conditionals opened the door to simulating real-world logic, error checking, and user interactivity.

The use of `nargin` and conditional flows emphasized the importance of writing fault-tolerant, flexible code. Many of these logic patterns will show up in future scripting, UI building, and simulation control.
