# 🔁 Module 7: Loops  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module7-loops`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module introduced iterative programming through `for` and `while` loops, enabling repetitive computations and controlled execution. It also explored logical indexing and its application in looped contexts.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Writing `for` loops with defined iteration counts
- Creating `while` loops with conditional exit behavior
- Loop control with `break`, `continue`, and logical operators
- Logical arrays and boolean indexing (`true`/`false`)
- Combining loops with conditionals for validation or error-checking
- Using loops to solve mathematical patterns and accumulate results

## 🪞 Reflection

This module made MATLAB feel like a real programming language. The ability to iterate, test, and exit loops based on logic makes it powerful for simulations, batch processing, and automation workflows. Looping gave me control over both structure and timing — a huge leap from the static operations earlier in the course.

The `while` loop examples especially helped me understand how simulations can “wait” for conditions to be true — a foundational idea in agent-based modeling and event-driven simulation systems.
