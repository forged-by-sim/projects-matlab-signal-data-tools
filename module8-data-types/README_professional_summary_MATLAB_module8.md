# 🧬 Module 8: Data Types  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module8-data-types`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module explored MATLAB’s more advanced data structures — particularly character arrays, cell arrays, and sparse matrices — enabling more dynamic, memory-efficient programming and text-based manipulation.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Creating and manipulating character vectors (`char`) and strings
- Working with cell arrays and nested cell content (`{}` vs `()`)
- Understanding sparse matrices and memory efficiency
- String indexing and conversion using ASCII values
- Implementing encryption using basic cipher logic (Caesar cipher)
- Hands-on practice with modular arithmetic and shifting characters

---

## 🧪 Assignments Completed

### 🔹 Character Vectors  
Practiced indexing, editing, and displaying character strings manually.

---

### 🔹 Cell Arrays  
Explored cell-based storage of heterogenous data types and proper referencing syntax.

---

### 🔹 Encryption Challenge (Caesar Cipher)  
Implemented two encryption methods using:
- `mod()` for ASCII wrapping
- `circshift()` for circular character shifts

## 🪞 Reflection

This module introduced a more text-centric and memory-conscious dimension to MATLAB. Learning how to encrypt messages, manipulate characters, and leverage sparse matrices added flexibility to my programming logic.

Most importantly, it showed how MATLAB — often thought of as a numeric environment — can be just as powerful with strings, logic, and abstract representations. This module opened the door to simulations that interact with the *meaning* of data, not just its numbers.
