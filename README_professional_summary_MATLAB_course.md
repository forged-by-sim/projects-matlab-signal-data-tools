# 📘 Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**University**: Vanderbilt University  
**Platform**: Coursera  
**Completed**: ✅ All 9 Modules  
**Repo**: `course-matlab`

## 🎯 Course Objective

This course served as a comprehensive introduction to core MATLAB programming fundamentals. Designed with engineers and scientists in mind, it covered the language’s core syntax, logic structures, data types, matrix manipulation, file I/O, and modular scripting practices — all through hands-on practice and challenge-based assignments.

By the end of this course, I had gained fluency in writing structured, testable MATLAB code and could simulate logic, interact with files, visualize results, and build real-world scripts.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MATLAB Online** (browser-based)
- `.m` script files for logic and modularity
- PNG screenshots of outputs for proof-of-work
- `.txt` solutions for algorithmic steps
- `.pdf` wrap-up summaries from Coursera
- `.xlsx` dataset usage (e.g., climate data)

## 📦 Directory Structure

Each module has its own folder containing:

- ✅ Cleanly written `.m` scripts  
- 📎 Assignment instructions or solution `.txt` files  
- 🖼️ Screenshots of function outputs + passed tests  
- 📄 Course-generated PDFs (`Lesson X.pdf`)  
- 🧾 A detailed `README_professional_summary_MATLAB_moduleX.md` write-up

🌟 Final Reflection

This course transformed MATLAB from an intimidating numerical tool into a programmable, logical environment where creativity and structure blend. I’ve come away with a command of:

Matrix-first thinking

Logical flow with conditionals and loops

Data structuring with cells, chars, and sparse arrays

File connectivity for real-world simulation output

A strong foundation for more advanced simulation scripting

It now serves as a cornerstone of my technical foundation as a simulation technologist.
