# 🔁 M7 – Loops & Iteration Logic  
**Folder**: `m7-nested-loops`  
**Focus**: Building iterative logic using `for`, `while`, and logical indexing for repeated actions and dynamic conditions

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **loop structures** to control how and when MATLAB code repeats actions. From counting and accumulating to conditional re-evaluation, I explored how to use both `for` and `while` loops in practical simulation scenarios. The bonus challenge pushed me to think algorithmically using custom logic within loops.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Writing `for` loops with fixed iteration ranges  
- Building `while` loops for dynamic, condition-based execution  
- Controlling loop flow with `break`, `continue`, and condition checks  
- Applying logical indexing to extract, evaluate, and manipulate subsets  
- Nesting loops and conditional structures  
- Creating simulation-like logic that evaluates, waits, and responds

🧠 Developer Reflection

This was the module where MATLAB began to feel alive — no longer just executing one thing after another, but looping, adapting, waiting, and checking. Loops simulate time, patience, and repetition — just like real systems. while loops in particular reminded me of simulators that “wait” for an action or trigger before proceeding.

The bonus challenge made me think algorithmically and reminded me that simulation isn’t about solving once — it’s about trying again and again until the right condition is met.

💬 “Loops simulate time. Logic gives it purpose.”
