# 🧮 M3 – Matrices, Operators & Visuals  
**Folder**: `m3-matrices-operators-visuals`  
**Focus**: Matrix creation, element-wise operations, indexing strategies, and output inspection

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced MATLAB’s core identity as a matrix-first language. I worked with square brackets to create arrays, practiced linear and subscript indexing, and explored the colon operator for slicing and sequence generation. I also tested element-wise operations and matrix arithmetic to compare broadcasting behavior and operator precedence.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Creating arrays and matrices using brackets `[]`  
- Using the colon operator `:` for indexing and sequence generation  
- Element-wise vs. matrix-level arithmetic: `.*`, `./`, `.^` vs `*`, `/`, `^`  
- Indexing: linear vs. subscript notation  
- Understanding dimension compatibility and broadcasting  
- Visualizing matrix behavior with output capture and debugging

## 🧠 Developer Reflection  
This was a pivotal module — not just for syntax, but for *thinking in arrays*. MATLAB treats matrices as default data structures, and understanding how indexing and broadcasting work was essential for every future project I built.

By learning when and why element-wise operators (`.*`, `./`, `.^`) matter, I became more confident in debugging dimensional mismatches and using matrices in scripts with greater control.
