# 🧮 Module 3: Matrices and Operators  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module3-matrices-and-operators`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module introduced MATLAB’s matrix-based structure and arithmetic engine. Students explored how to create, manipulate, and access elements within matrices using both explicit indexing and built-in operators.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Defining matrices and arrays using brackets `[]`
- Colon operator (`:`) for range creation and indexing
- Matrix arithmetic: addition, subtraction, scalar and element-wise operations (`.*`, `./`)
- Matrix indexing (linear and subscript)
- Dimension compatibility and broadcasting
- Transposition (`'`), dot operations, and operator precedence

## 🪞 Reflection

This module provided a deep dive into MATLAB’s core identity as a matrix manipulation platform. Unlike traditional programming languages, MATLAB treats matrices as default data structures — so understanding the nuances of the colon operator, vectorized operations, and indexing strategies was essential.

Learning how to apply element-wise operations (`.*`, `./`) versus matrix operations helped clarify when and how MATLAB automatically performs broadcasting or throws dimension errors. These skills were foundational for future modules involving loops, conditionals, and function-based workflows.
