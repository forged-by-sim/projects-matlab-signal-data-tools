# 🧠 MATLAB Signal & Data Tools  
**Repository**: `projects-matlab-signal-data-tools`  
**Focus**: Core MATLAB programming, data manipulation, and simulation-ready workflows

⸻

## 🎯 Overview
This repository showcases a structured progression of MATLAB development, moving from environment setup and matrix fundamentals to **custom functions, control flow, structured data types, and external data handling**.

Rather than treating MATLAB as a numerical calculator, these projects frame it as a **general-purpose programming environment** capable of powering simulations, data pipelines, and algorithmic tooling.

Each module is organized as a **self-contained technical unit**, emphasizing clarity, reusability, and verifiable outputs.

## 🛠️ Skills & Techniques Demonstrated
- Matrix-first problem solving and vectorized computation  
- Custom function design and modular scripting  
- Conditional logic and loop-based control flow  
- Structured data handling (cells, structs, sparse matrices)  
- File-based input/output (text, spreadsheets, images)  
- Output validation through repeatable test results

🧠 Developer Reflection

This project series represents the transition from learning MATLAB syntax to engineering with MATLAB.

The emphasis on modular design, structured data, and file interaction mirrors how MATLAB is used in simulation pipelines, data processing systems, and analytical tooling. These foundations support more advanced work in signal processing, modeling, and system-level simulations.

From matrices to meaning — MATLAB as a programmable system, not just a calculator.
