# 🧪 Module 2: MATLAB Environment  
**Course**: Introduction to Programming with MATLAB  
**Platform**: Coursera – Vanderbilt University  
**Module Folder**: `module2-matlab-environment`

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This module introduced the foundational tools and interface components within the MATLAB programming environment. It focused on navigating the layout, executing simple calculations, and using built-in documentation tools to support self-guided learning.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Navigating the MATLAB interface: Command Window, Editor, Workspace, and History
- Basic command usage: `clc`, `clear`, `format short/long`
- Arithmetic operations and operator precedence
- Using `help`, `doc`, and the documentation browser
- Assigning and modifying variables
- Output display using `disp()` and variable evaluation

---

## 🧮 Assignments Completed

### 🔹 Lesson 1 Wrap-Up  
Designed to reinforce command line interaction and variable assignment through small problems.

- Practiced entering commands directly into the Command Window
- Assigned variables and ran quick calculations
- Explored the results via screenshots and reflection

### 🔹 MATLAB Calculator  
A scripted calculator using basic arithmetic and variable assignments.

- Created a simple calculator that adds, multiplies, and evaluates expressions
- Saved results to variables and used `disp()` for user-friendly output

## 🪞 Reflection

This module helped me become comfortable within MATLAB’s interface, particularly understanding how the different panels (Command Window, Editor, Workspace) communicate during execution. Using basic arithmetic to build a calculator may seem trivial, but it helped reinforce operator precedence and output formatting.

By exploring the help system and running small test expressions, I built the confidence to navigate errors independently — a skill that paid off in later modules involving more complex logic and data types.
