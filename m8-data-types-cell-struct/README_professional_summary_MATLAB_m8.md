# 🧩 M8 – Data Types: Characters, Cell Arrays & Structures  
**Folder**: `m8-data-types-cell-struct`  
**Focus**: Working with character vectors, cell arrays, sparse matrices, and memory-efficient data structures

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This module expanded MATLAB’s numeric core into the **textual and structural domains**.  
I learned how to handle strings and characters, build dynamic containers like cell arrays, and optimize data representation using sparse matrices.  
Encryption logic, Caesar ciphers, and custom data referencing highlighted MATLAB’s versatility beyond pure computation.

## 🧠 Developer Reflection  
This module introduced a more **text-centric and memory-conscious** perspective on MATLAB.  
I learned how to encrypt, manipulate, and interpret data at the character level — bringing me one step closer to building simulations that reflect **meaning**, not just numbers.

It also showed me how to select the **right structure for the task** — whether that’s a sparse matrix for efficiency, a cell array for flexibility, or a simple string for encryption logic.
